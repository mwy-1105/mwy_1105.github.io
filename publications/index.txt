We develop the GRALB model, which is based on Role-Based Collaboration (RBC) in cooperative services, to comprehensively manage the offloading strategy of terminal user tasks between edge nodes and the cloud to solve the joint communication and computing resource allocation problem in intelligent manufacturing systems. First, we jointly model the end-to-end latency and energy consumption based on the physical scenario of cloud-edge collaboration. Then, we extend the GRA model based on E-CARGO and propose the GRALB model with load balancing, which formally models the original joint communication and computing resource allocation problem as an equivalent cooperative service model and provides a proof of algorithm convergence. Finally, we design an x-ILP solution to support the verification and integrated application of the proposed model. Simulation results further confirm our theoretical analysis and show that the proposed collaborative cloud and edge computing solution significantly improves the overall system performance.17:T7b8,@article{GAO2025100776,

}18:T455,In recent years, convolutional neural networks have seen rapid advancements, leading to the proposal of numerous lightweight image super-resolution techniques tailored for deployment on edge devices. This paper examines the information distillation mechanism and the vast-receptive-field attention mechanism utilized in lightweight super-resolution. Additionally, it introduces a new network structure named the vast-receptive-field feature distillation network, named VFDN, which effectively enhances inference speed and reduces GPU memory consumption. The receptive field of the attention block is expanded, and the utilization of large dense convolution kernels is substituted with depth-wise separable convolutions. Meanwhile, we modify the reconstruction block to obtain better reconstruction quality and introduce a Fourier transform-based loss function that emphasizes the frequency domain information of the input image. Experiments show that the designed VFDN achieves comparable results to RFDN, but the parameters are only 307K(55.81% of RFDN), which is advantageous for deployment on edge devices.19:T63b,@article{Zhang2025,

}1a:T624,Artificial Intelligence (AI) products have been widely integrated into human life, and these applications often involve multiple Deep Learning (DL) models, characterized by high computational demands and real-time performance requirements. We extend the GRA and GRA++ model based on E-CARGO for the development of the Group Role Assignment for Face Recognition (GRA4FR) model, which is based on Role-Based Collaboration (RBC) in cooperative services, to comprehensively manage the offloading strategy of terminal user tasks between terminal devices and Edge Computing (EC) servers to solve the joint communication and computing resource allocation problem. Furthermore, a two-level Load Balancing (LB) strategy is proposed: the first level targets EC servers using RBC-based methods, while the second level manages GPU scheduling for multi-GPU machines. Through real-world scenario simulations, we demonstrate that this dual-layered LB approach is crucial for maintaining system performance under dynamic workloads. Additionally, the mathematical formulation of task computational workload, as a key variable affecting system performance metrics, is further refined. Simulation results highlight the factors (the number of individuals on screen, the rate at which people pass by) as significant influences on system throughput and latency, underscoring the need for adaptive load balancing. Extensive numerical evaluations validate that our proposed method significantly enhances system efficiency, ensuring reliable performance in high-demand edge computing environments.1b:T88f,@inproceedings{11033292,

}1c:T656,With the widespread use of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) in smart manufacturing systems in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and 5G networks, determining how to efficiently offload computing tasks has become a hot research area. The Role-Based Collaboration (RBC) Environments-Classes, Agents, Roles, Groups, and Objects (E-CARGO) model is introduced to comprehensively manage MEC servers and user computation tasks in edge network environments, thereby improving the effectiveness and performance of task offloading in smart manufacturing systems. To begin with, latency and energy consumption are important indicators for evaluating the offloading effect. A pre-allocation algorithm based on user latency tolerance is proposed to dynamically adjust the latency-energy consumption weighting factor to optimize system resource allocation for real-time adjustment of offloading decisions. Second, the Group Role Assignment of Agent Role Conflicts (GRACAR) model based on E-CARGO is extended, along with a dynamic weighting of the GRACAR (GRACAR-DW) model and formal modeling. By introducing resource contention constraints, the resource contention caused by excessive task data offloading to the same MEC server is proactively mitigated. Finally, a Gurobi solution based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is developed to help validate and synthesize the proposed model. Simulation results show that the strategy considerably enhances the MEC system's overall performance in terms of latency and energy consumption while also providing new ideas and technological support for offloading decisions in edge networks.1d:T89c,@article{MAO2024100695,

各行各业的线上线下电子商务模式(online to offline, O2O) 也应运而生, 然而,同质化竞争和数据价值挖掘不足的问题限制了市场的持续向好发展。聚焦于O2O 模式下的顾客满意度研究, 提出了一种新型的中文文本预测模型, 命名为W2V-ATT-LSTM。该模型引入Attention 机制以提高对重要文本的感知能力, 进一步融合W2V 和LSTM 结构, 深度挖掘头部企业真实交易数据进行分析处理、特征选择和模型训练。通过LDA 模型进行主题挖掘, 深入了解消费者对产品或服务的感受, 为企业提供有针对性的改进建议。实验结果显示,W2V-ATT-LSTM 模型在公开数据集任务中的准确率(91.4%)、精确率(82.2%)、召回率(81.7%) 和F1 (81.4%) 等指标均优于KNN、贝叶斯、决策树、SVM 等传统机器学习算法; 在爬虫真实数据集任务中的准确率(94%)、精确率(90%)、召回率(89%) 和F1 (89%) 也优于W2V、LSTM、Bi-LSTM 和Bert; 在多个公开中文情感分析数据集上的优越性能也表明W2V-ATT-LSTM 对于理解和处理自然语言文本具有显著的实际应用价值。在当前竞争激烈的O2O市场, W2V-ATT-LSTM 模型能为顾客与商家提供可靠的决策参考,
