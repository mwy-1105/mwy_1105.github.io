a:T656,With the widespread use of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) in smart manufacturing systems in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and 5G networks, determining how to efficiently offload computing tasks has become a hot research area. The Role-Based Collaboration (RBC) Environments-Classes, Agents, Roles, Groups, and Objects (E-CARGO) model is introduced to comprehensively manage MEC servers and user computation tasks in edge network environments, thereby improving the effectiveness and performance of task offloading in smart manufacturing systems. To begin with, latency and energy consumption are important indicators for evaluating the offloading effect. A pre-allocation algorithm based on user latency tolerance is proposed to dynamically adjust the latency-energy consumption weighting factor to optimize system resource allocation for real-time adjustment of offloading decisions. Second, the Group Role Assignment of Agent Role Conflicts (GRACAR) model based on E-CARGO is extended, along with a dynamic weighting of the GRACAR (GRACAR-DW) model and formal modeling. By introducing resource contention constraints, the resource contention caused by excessive task data offloading to the same MEC server is proactively mitigated. Finally, a Gurobi solution based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is developed to help validate and synthesize the proposed model. Simulation results show that the strategy considerably enhances the MEC system's overall performance in terms of latency and energy consumption while also providing new ideas and technological support for offloading decisions in edge networks.b:T89c,@article{MAO2024100695,

}c:T420,With the rapid growth of service computing and collaborative computing, customers increasingly demand Quality of Service (QoS), and the assignment of service composition suppliers has become critical to realizing high-quality delivery. Environments-Classes, Agents, Roles, Groups, and Objects (E-CARGO) has gained much attention as a conceptual model for Role-Based Collaboration (RBC). Extending E-CARGO-based Group Multi-Role Assignment (GMRA), we propose a similarity-constrained Team Multi-Role Assignment (TMRASC) model applicable to the service computing domain, which bridges the core of RBC with QoS to form a QoS-driven supplier assignment. The model integrates subservice similarity and common team goals to maximize group performance and synergy. The TMRASC is formally modeled and a Gurobi solution based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is designed.

类、Agents、角色、组和对象(environments-classes, Agents, roles, groups and objects, E-CARGO) 模型作为一种基于角色协同(role-based collaboration, RBC) 技术受到了广泛关注。通过对基于E-CARGO 的组多角色分配(group multi-role assignment, GMRA) 模型开展研究, 提出了一个普适度更高的角色依赖的团队多角色分配(team multi-role assignment with role dependency, TMRARD) 模型, 涉及到引入角色依赖关系和团队共同目标后, 如何将协作单元(Agents) 有效分配给角色, 以最大化群体表现与协同效应。将TMRARD 形式化建模, 针对角色依赖约束的复杂性, 对依赖输入规模进行合理性分析,
